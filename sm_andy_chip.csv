The beta-2-adrenergic receptor is responsible for increases in bronchodilation, ventricular function, and vasodilation, which impact the cardiovascular and pulmonary response to exercise. The beta-3-adrenergic receptor is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis.","rs1042713",20044476,438,0,"0.01","n/a","749",1,"A","AG",1,1,NA,NA,NA
